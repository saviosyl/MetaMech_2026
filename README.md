## 🔧 Beyond Traditional SolidWorks Macros

If you've ever written (or inherited) a SolidWorks VBA macro, you know the pain: brittle code, no error handling, breaks on version upgrades, and nobody in the company understands how it works.

**MetaMech replaces that entire approach.**

| Traditional SolidWorks Macro | MetaMech |
|---|---|
| ❌ Requires VBA / .NET knowledge | ✅ No coding — ever |
| ❌ Breaks between SolidWorks versions | ✅ Tested across SolidWorks 2020–2026 |
| ❌ Single-purpose scripts | ✅ Full automation suite, constantly updated |
| ❌ No UI — edit code to change behavior | ✅ Clean interface with options and presets |
| ❌ No support — "ask Dave, he wrote it" | ✅ Professional support from MetaMech Solutions |
| ❌ Hard to share across a team | ✅ Enterprise licensing & centralized config |

MetaMech isn't a SolidWorks macro — it's what SolidWorks macros wish they could be. It's a professional-grade design automation tool built for real engineering workflows.
